# IoT-Based Smart Temperature Logger System

## Project Overview

This project is an IoT-based temperature monitoring system designed for real-time data logging and remote monitoring. The system measures temperature using a digital sensor and sends the data wirelessly to the cloud using MQTT protocol. A Node-RED dashboard displays live temperature readings and provides alerts when temperature exceeds a predefined limit.

## Features

* Real-time temperature monitoring
* Wireless data transmission using Wi-Fi
* MQTT-based lightweight communication
* Live dashboard visualization using Node-RED
* Threshold-based alert system
* Cloud-based remote access

## Hardware Components

* ESP32 Microcontroller
* Temperature Sensor (DHT11)
* Power Supply
* Connecting Wires

## Software / Platforms Used

* Arduino IDE
* MQTT Protocol
* Node-RED
* IoT Cloud
* Wi-Fi

## Working Principle

The temperature sensor continuously measures ambient temperature and sends the data to the ESP32. The ESP32 processes the data and publishes it to an MQTT broker over Wi-Fi. Node-RED subscribes to this data, displays it on a live dashboard, and triggers alerts if the temperature crosses the set threshold.

## Applications

* Industrial temperature monitoring
* Server rooms
* Cold storage facilities
* Alloy Casting industries
* Smart factories

## Objective

To build a simple, reliable, and cost-effective IoT solution for real-time temperature monitoring and cloud-based data visualization suitable for industrial and automation applications.
